# Changelog

All notable changes to **`@syrin/iris`** are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-22

The 1.0 release. Iris is stable, documented, and benchmarked end to end: every package is versioned
`1.0.0` under the open-core license split, and the same verify loop that wins on a toy app stays the
cheapest way to observe a real production dashboard.

The headline is the "lean responses" pass — same observations, fewer tokens. On the cross-tool
detection benchmark Iris's average observation cost drops 959 → 815 tokens with detection unchanged at
1.0 and zero false positives, lifting Verification Efficiency past the best external tool (12.27 vs
10.55) while remaining the only tool that catches every regression. Re-verifying a saved suite costs
47 tokens with no model and 0% flake, up to **2,574× cheaper** than re-driving it with an LLM.

### Added

- **Honest, reproducible benchmarks with a small-app vs real-app story.** A committed benchmark image
  set (re-run efficiency, the two-apps small-vs-real comparison, the per-tool cost on the real Syrin
  dashboard, and a capability matrix) rendered from a public source pipeline (`assets/benchmarks` +
  a shared design system), with the methodology written up in [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).
  On a real production dashboard Iris observes a page for 1,023 tokens vs Chrome DevTools MCP's 1,357
  and Playwright MCP's 2,193, and is the only tool that asserts success from the app's own signal.
- **Documentation set** — an [architecture overview](docs/architecture.md), the benchmarks explainer,
  an expanded [getting-started](docs/getting-started.md), and a Mintlify configuration so the docs
  publish as a site.
- **Open-source project hygiene** — `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull-request
  templates, plus contributor / stargazer / forker recognition in the README.

### Changed

- **`iris_act` collapses a clean action to its consequence** — the effect block now omits fields at
  their uninformative default (an absent `dispatched`/`targetMatched`/`visible`/`enabled` means `true`;
  an absent `focusMoved`/`occludedBy` means `null`; an absent `occluded`/`scrolledIntoView`/
  `valueChanged`/`defaultPrevented` means `false`), so a successful click returns just `domMutatedWithin`
  and any real signal still surfaces. No information is lost — absence always means the boring value.
- **MCP tool results serialize as compact JSON by default** — the agent-facing `text` content drops the
  two-space indentation (the typed `structuredContent` is unchanged), ~40% cheaper on the structured
  payloads that dominate. Set `IRIS_ENCODING=pretty` for the previous indented form; `IRIS_ENCODING=toon`
  remains the densest tabular encoding.
- **`iris_act_and_wait` returns a reaction digest, not the full timeline** — `trace` is now
  `{ window_ms, summary }` (the counts that answer "what did the app do?") plus a `since` cursor; the full
  per-event timeline is one `iris_observe { since }` away when the counts aren't enough. On a large DOM the
  dropped events array was the bulk of the loop cost — a verify loop on a 5,000-row grid falls from ~531 to
  ~279 tokens with the consequence still asserted from the `row:approved` signal.

### Fixed

- **Multiple apps on one machine no longer collide or orphan the daemon.** Several Next.js / React apps
  (or browser tabs) can run at once: the `@syrin/iris-next` integration now defaults to a unique per-tab
  session id (`SESSION_AUTO`) instead of a shared constant, so two Next apps never silently evict each
  other. A bridge/daemon **port collision now fails fast with a clear error** instead of hanging forever
  and leaving an orphaned process — the `listen()` calls finally handle `EADDRINUSE`.
- **License files now carry a real copyright.** Filled the Apache-2.0 appendix in every SDK package
  license so no `[yyyy]` / `[name of copyright owner]` placeholders remain.

### Security

- **Daemon mode now enforces the documented auth contract.** `iris serve` / the MCP daemon previously
  built its bridge without forwarding the pairing `token`, bind `host`, or origin allow-list, so
  `IRIS_TOKEN` / `IRIS_HOST` / `IRIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` were silently ignored in daemon mode. They are now
  honored identically to the in-process path. (Residual risk was bounded — the daemon is loopback-pinned —
  but the advertised control is now actually enforced.)
- **Every security-critical environment variable is a single named constant** (`IrisEnv` in
  `@syrin/iris-protocol`). A typo in an inline `'IRIS_TOKEN'` string could previously have disabled auth
  silently; the names now live in exactly one place.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-21

The "verify anywhere, ready for enterprises" release. One command verifies a running app from any
pipeline — no MCP, no human — and enterprise features unlock with an offline license.

### Added

- **`iris verify <url>`** — one-shot, non-MCP verification: drives the preview, replays the saved
  flows, prints a deterministic verdict, and exits non-zero on fail. The command CI and AI
  app-builder platforms call without speaking MCP — the same `IrisVerificationRun` artifact the MCP
  and HTTP paths produce.
- **Drive a hosted preview** — for a non-localhost URL, Iris re-invokes the page's `iris.connect()`
  (allow-non-localhost + a one-shot pairing token) so a deployed preview pairs to the local bridge
  with no app redeploy; `iris verify --storage-state <file>` replays a logged-in session past an
  auth wall.
- **Enterprise licensing** — `iris license` shows activation status; offline Ed25519 keys
  (`IRIS_LICENSE_KEY`) verify locally with **no phone-home**. Open-core split: Apache-2.0 SDK, FSL
  server/CLI, Iris Enterprise License for `ee/` features.
- **Branded id types** — `RunId` is nominal end-to-end, so ids can't be confused with flow names.

### Changed

- **Hardened persistence + HTTP boundary** — atomic run writes, bounded `.iris/runs` retention,
  verify-server request/timeout limits, a frozen contract-lock test, and path-traversal guards on
  read and write.

### Fixed

- Oracle-backed flows now report **high** confidence — the success consequence propagates into the
  verdict instead of reading as a smoke test.
- A localhost preview connects to the bridge without a token mismatch; hosted-preview origins are
  allow-listed.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-20

The "developers love it" release. 0.7.0 won the agent; 0.8.0 wins the human — the dev who watches the
agent work, points at what's wrong, and trusts the green.

### Added

- **Human review marks — "annotate the bug where you see it"** (`packages/browser`, `packages/server`,
  `packages/protocol`). A dev-only **"Flag a bug"** button rides with the presenter: the human toggles
  it, clicks the element that looks wrong, types what's wrong, and Iris drops a numbered pin + emits a
  `HUMAN_MARK`. The mark carries the element's re-resolvable anchor (the same durable address a
  recorded flow uses) **and the source `file:line`** — so the agent fixes the exact element and code,
  not a guess. The agent drains marks with the new **`iris_review`** tool: each pending mark comes with
  a ready-to-act `fix` hint (`Open src/Checkout.tsx:42 and fix: <note>. Then iris_review { resolve: m1 }`),
  reading never consumes a mark, and `resolve` retires it once fixed. Off the deterministic benchmark
  path (human-driven) — `pnpm bench` unchanged.
- **First-run readiness + loop intro — `iris_wait_ready`** (`packages/server`). Call it right after
  init: it blocks until the app's SDK connects (returns instantly if a session already exists, so zero
  latency on the happy path and on the benchmark), or times out with a `recovery` hint. Smooths the
  most common first-5-minutes footgun — the agent's first real call racing the WebSocket connect. Its
  ready response also carries a one-line **`loop` guide** (look → act → observe → assert → regress, plus
  the human-flag → `iris_review` loop), so a fresh agent learns how to drive Iris on its first call
  without reading docs. Pure, injected clock/sleep; off the benchmark path.
- **Deterministic visual regression — `iris_viewport`** (`packages/server`). Pin the driven page to a
  fixed viewport size (clamped to sane bounds) so a screenshot baseline is reproducible across machines
  — the last missing piece of CI-stable visual diffing, alongside the already-shipped `iris_visual_diff`
  `masks` (neutralize volatile regions) and a frozen clock (`iris_clock`). Drive-only, additive; off the
  benchmark path. Provider-driven and tested via a fake page like `iris_network_mock`.
- **CDP network mock / intercept — `iris_network_mock`** (`packages/server`). On a driven page
  (`iris drive`), stub a request deterministically: return a `500`, force offline (abort), or delay a
  response — so "verify the app handles a failed payment" is one declared rule, no backend changes. The
  matcher is pure (first rule whose url-substring + optional method matches wins → fulfill/abort/continue)
  and the Playwright `page.route` wiring is driven in tests with a fake Page/Route. Needs a driven
  browser; returns a `recommendation` to `iris drive` otherwise. Off the agent/benchmark path.
- **`iris status` shows sessions + health at a glance** (`packages/server`). The daemon exposes a
  local `GET /status`; `iris status` now reports each connected tab (url, throttled, stale, pending
  human marks) and the session count — not just "running: pid". The plan's "no more pkill in a README"
  daemon DX. Local-only, off the agent/benchmark path.
- **Actionable error recovery** (`packages/server`). Every tool error returned to the agent now carries
  a `recovery` hint when the failure is recognized — the no-session footgun, multiple/unknown sessions,
  a throttled tab, a missing baseline/recording, the pairing-token config — so the first 5 minutes never
  dead-end on "what do I do now?". Conservative: an unrecognized error gets no invented advice.
- **The panel always reflects the agent's real state — `iris_yield`** (`packages/server`,
  `packages/browser`, `packages/protocol`). A human watching the browser must never see "live" when the
  agent has actually stopped. The agent signals its turn boundary with **`iris_yield({ mode: "waiting" })`**
  (done responding, will resume on your next message) or **`{ mode: "ask", note }`** (blocked, needs your
  answer — the question shows on the panel); the session is revived automatically on the agent's next
  call. Taught as the mandatory last step in the session lease, the loop guide, and the skill — and it's
  **agent-independent** (Codex / OpenCode / Claude / Hermes). The panel renders each handback distinctly
  via a PRESENTER `tone`: waiting = calm teal ✋, ask = amber ❓ pulse, **agent crashed/disconnected** =
  amber ⚠ pulse, a clean end = calm green. When the last agent's MCP connection drops, the daemon ends
  every session and pushes the "switch to your terminal" notice (verified end-to-end through a SIGKILL-ed
  agent). Off the benchmark path.
- **Don't lose a panel prompt in the death-race** (`packages/server`, `packages/protocol`). If the human
  types a message into the panel at the exact moment the agent stops, it would land in a dead inbox; now
  both the agent-detach and idle paths fold any unread note into the end banner — quoted and labeled
  `Undelivered (paste into your terminal): "…"` — so the words are surfaced back, not silently dropped.
- **Replay a saved flow from the panel — no agent** (`packages/browser`, `packages/server`,
  `packages/protocol`). The daemon pushes the saved-flow names to the HUD on connect; the human clicks
  **▶** on a flow and it re-runs with no agent in the loop — the page animates via the normal replay path
  and the ✓ / ⚠ drift / ✗ verdict lands in the same activity log they watch the agent in. The dev plays
  the regression suite directly. Off the benchmark path (a panel-driven control, not a tool).

### Changed

- **Internal cohesion split** (no behavior change): `SessionManager` moved to its own
  `session-manager.ts`, and the on-disk-artifact constants to `flow-constants.ts`, bringing both
  parent files back under the 500-line cap. All public import paths unchanged (re-exported).

### Fixed

- **Panel composer is now multi-line** (`packages/browser`). The HUD message box was a single-line
  `<input>` that sent on any Enter; it's a `<textarea>` now — **Enter sends, Shift+Enter inserts a
  newline**, and it auto-grows to fit.
- **Flag mode keeps the right cursors** (`packages/browser`). In "Flag a bug" mode every element showed
  the crosshair, including the Flag button and its popover — which are clickable; they keep the pointer
  cursor now. And the hover outline that boxes the element under the cursor no longer snaps jumpily: it
  **waits for the cursor to rest (~130 ms), then glides into place on an ease** and fades in.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-20

The regression-testing release. Iris's flow `success` is now a **declared, deterministic, post-settle
consequence** over program truth — not just "the element is there" — and the same flow replays with no
LLM, so a CI gate diffs the verdict exactly (0% flake) at a fraction of the tokens an LLM re-drive costs.

### Added

- **`state` predicate — assert store truth** (`packages/server`, `packages/protocol`). Assert a value
  inside a registered store the DOM never showed: `{ kind: "state", store?, path, equals? }`, with
  `equals` a literal or a `{ $gte | $contains | $length }` operator. Available in `iris_assert`,
  `iris_act_and_wait`, as a per-step `assert-state` invariant, and as a flow `success-state` golden
  end-condition. Catches a UI-vs-store **desync** and a dead-handler **green-but-wrong** regression that
  no DOM read can — the success oracle fails when the store didn't change, with no testid drift.
- **Flow consequence family — `net { count }`, `console { absent }`, `state { hold }`**
  (`packages/server`, `packages/protocol`). A flow's `success` (via `iris_annotate success-state`) now
  compiles to a real predicate over more than presence: `net { count }` asserts a request fired EXACTLY
  N times (catches a **double-submit** / retry-storm a presence check passes); `console { absent }`
  asserts the action left a **clean console** (catches a silent `console.error`); `state { hold }` asserts
  an unrelated store path **did not move** (catches an action's unintended **blast-radius** side-effect).
  Cardinality/absence/invariant predicates are read **post-settle** so a wait-until-true check can't pass
  before the regression lands.
- **Design-token awareness in `iris_inspect`** (`packages/server`, `packages/browser`). Inspect now
  reports theme compliance — `{ colorToken, backgroundToken, offTheme, tokenCount }` — so an
  off-palette color (a value no design token defines) is observable in one call, not just "a color rendered."
- **React render meter** (`packages/react`). `installRenderMeter()` augments the React DevTools hook to
  count commits and registers an `__iris_renders` store; `iris_state` reads the commit rate, so a
  **wasted-render storm** (re-renders with identical output → no DOM mutation) is visible where a
  screenshot/DOM tool sees an idle page. `getRenderStats()` / `resetRenderMeter()` exported; host-safe.
- **Component auto-anchors — address any element with zero hand-added testids** (`packages/browser`,
  `packages/server`). `iris_query by:"component"` resolves elements by component identity / source
  location, and recorded flows synthesize a stable `component` anchor (fiber → component → `file:line`)
  when no `data-testid` resolves, instead of degrading the step.
- **`iris_flow_verify` — one-call suite regression check** (`packages/server`). Re-verify a K-flow suite
  and get one consolidated verdict (passing counted, only failures detailed), so an agent's read-cost is
  roughly constant in suite size.
- **On-demand tool loading — `dynamic` / `hybrid` MCP profiles** (`packages/server`). Load tool schemas
  as needed instead of paying for the full set up front, cutting the agent's per-turn token floor.
- **Richer observation** (`packages/browser`, `packages/server`): a `net.pending` signal for in-flight /
  hung requests; generic-container text in the snapshot so a silent DOM removal is visible; a grid
  layout signature so a CLS/layout regression shows up.

### Changed

- **Leaner agent verify loop** (`packages/server`). Terser tool descriptions and compact
  `iris_network` / `iris_console` projections on the lean profiles roughly halve the per-turn token cost;
  `core` is the default profile tuned for the build-verify loop.

### Fixed

- **`iris_visual_diff` returned a shape its schema rejected** (`packages/server`). The tool's
  `outputSchema` declared `{ ok, match, diffPct }` but the handler returned the diff engine's real shape
  (`{ matched, changedPixels, ratio, … }`) and never set `ok`, so every real diff failed MCP output
  validation. The schema now matches the handler (`ok` plus the real fields); dimension-mismatch returns
  `{ ok:false, reason }`.
- **`iris_flow_save` / `iris_save_recorded` output schemas didn't match their handlers**
  (`packages/server`), breaking those tools over MCP. Schemas corrected.
- **`iris_state` output validation + path scoping** (`packages/server`, `packages/protocol`). `iris_state`
  no longer fails output validation, and `path`/`depth` selection is applied **in-page before transport
  truncation**, so a scoped read of a large store is no longer truncated to the wrong fields.
- **Transport sanitizer no longer redacts design-token fields** (`packages/browser`). A broad `token`
  redaction rule was clobbering `colorToken` / `tokenCount`; it's now scoped to auth-credential patterns.

## [0.6.10] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Deterministic waiting — the `settled` predicate** (`packages/server`). A new predicate
  `{ kind: "settled", quietMs }` passes once network + structural-DOM activity has been quiet for
  `quietMs` (default 500ms); ambient `dom.text`/animation churn (count-ups, spinners) is ignored so
  an animated page can still settle. Usable in `iris_wait_for` and `iris_assert`, and composable inside
  `allOf` with the consequence you expect. Replaces fixed sleeps — the #1 cause of flaky agent tests.
- **`iris_act_and_wait` auto-settle** (`packages/server`). Omit `until` and the tool waits for the page
  to settle instead of requiring a predicate — "act, then wait for quiet" is now a single zero-config
  call, the documented alternative to a sleep.
- **`iris_query` token controls** (`packages/server`) — `limit` (cap returned descriptors; reports
  `total` + `truncated` so a trim is never silent) and `count_only` (return just the match count).
- **`iris_network` / `iris_console` token controls** (`packages/server`) — `limit` (keep the most
  recent N matches, reporting `total` + `droppedOldest`) and a `cost:{bytes,tokens}` hint, matching the
  other read tools so the agent can self-budget everywhere.
- **`iris_domain` `mustHold` per flow** (`packages/server`) — each flow now reports the success
  consequence that must hold for it (signal name / net URL), so an agent can answer "what are the
  critical flows and what must hold for each?" from the domain model alone.

### Changed

- **Self-healing now verifies the consequence before persisting** (`packages/server`). `iris_flow_heal`
  with `apply:true` re-replays the healed flow and re-asserts its success consequence; if a rebound
  locator resolves but the flow no longer satisfies its intent, the write is **refused**
  (`status:consequence_broken`, file untouched). It heals the locator, never the intent.

### Fixed

- **Browser observers fully restore patched globals on teardown** (`packages/browser`). The network,
  route, and console observers stored a bound copy and assigned it back on teardown, so `window.fetch`
  / `history.pushState` / `console.*` were never restored to their original identity. They now keep the
  true original for restore and a bound copy only for invocation.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **`iris mcp` — smart proxy with auto-start** (`packages/server`). Run `iris mcp --drive <url>` and you're
  done: it starts the daemon if one isn't running, waits for it to be ready, then bridges
  Claude Code's stdin/stdout to the daemon's SSE endpoint. Users no longer manage the daemon manually.
- **`iris mcp --drive <url>` / `iris serve --drive <url>`** — pass a URL and Iris launches its own
  Playwright browser at that URL, giving the agent full autonomous control without relying on the
  user's open browser tab.
- **`iris mcp --headed` / `--headed` flag** — opt in to a visible browser window so you can watch
  exactly what the agent is doing.
- **Three new update MCP tools** (`packages/server`):
  - `iris_version_info` — returns the installed version, execution kind (npx / global / local), and
    whether a newer version is available on npm.
  - `iris_apply_update` — upgrades Iris in place; requires `confirm: true` to actually run.
  - `iris_rollback` — downgrades to the previous version; requires `confirm: true`.
- **Presenter mode** (`packages/browser`, `packages/server`) — `iris.connect({ present: true })` mounts a
  dev-only HUD overlay that the agent can control: `iris_narrate` shows a caption, `iris_highlight`
  draws a ring around any element. The HUD is excluded from snapshots and tree-shaken in production.
- **Unified `SKILL.md` at repo root** — a single skill file auto-detects mode: setup wizard on first
  run (no `.iris.json`), live-app testing on every run after. Covers Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and Zed MCP config formats.
- **`.iris.json` project config** — written after first-run setup; persists `port`, `headed`,
  `framework`, and `harnesses` so subsequent runs need zero questions.
- **`dev:iris` script** in `apps/demo` — second Vite dev server on port 4310, isolated from the user's normal dev port.

### Fixed

- **All-throttled session auto-selection** (`packages/server`). When every connected tab is hidden
  (e.g. user is in VS Code with Chrome on another desktop), `SessionManager.resolve()` now picks the session with the freshest heartbeat instead of throwing `"multiple sessions connected"`.
- **Presenter HUD shows on bridge connect** — the overlay now mounts as soon as the SDK connects to the bridge, not only after the first `iris_narrate` call.
- **`iris_narrate` MCP schema validation** — relaxed the output schema so the tool no longer rejects responses from narration calls.
- **`iris_inspect` / `iris_clock` output schemas** — relaxed to pass through extra fields instead of stripping them, fixing spurious validation errors.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-11

First public release. Iris gives your coding agent **eyes** into your running web app and returns a
**verdict with evidence** instead of a screenshot.

### Added

- **The verify loop over MCP** — `look → act → observe → assert`. `iris_assert` evaluates a structured
  predicate against the live app and returns `{ pass, evidence, failureReason? }`, typically in ~100 tokens.
- **Six reaction types in one assert** — network calls, DOM changes, SPA navigation, console & errors
  (including "no errors during this flow"), animations, and app **signals**.
- **App signals** — `iris.signal()` lets your app emit the facts a screenshot can't see (the store
  committed, the webhook arrived); a bundled ESLint rule flags mutations that forgot to emit one.
- **Regression detection** — `iris_baseline_save` + `iris_diff` to catch silently removed elements or new
  console errors before they ship.
- **Source mapping** — DOM element → React component → `file:line`, on React 18/19 and Next.js (keeps SWC).
- **Autonomous crawler** (`iris_crawl`) that clicks every reachable control and classifies what breaks.
- **Declarative spec runner** (`@syrin/iris/test`) for signal-bound, headless verification specs.
- **The `iris` CLI** — bridge + MCP server, plus `iris drive` for a launched browser.
- **Single package, subpaths** — `@syrin/iris` ships the browser SDK (`.`), the server (`./server`), the
  spec runner (`./test`), source mapping (`./next`, `./babel`), and the lint rule (`./eslint`) — one install.

### Notes

- **Dev-only and localhost-only by default**; observers are additive and reversible, and the SDK is
  tree-shaken out of production. No telemetry.
- **Token efficiency** — a full verify loop is ~100 tokens vs ~7,300 for a full-tree snapshot (~73× on the
  common loop; ~1.8× full-tree-vs-full-tree). See [`docs/token-efficiency.md`](docs/token-efficiency.md)
  for the methodology and honest caveats.
